You can create multiple configs and specify them like -config=configa.json

If the config doesn't exist, it will generate a fresh one.

Simply create a shortcut to evil.exe, go into properties and add -config=different_config.json... or whatever  you like..........
This way, you can easily change Evil TTS Settings :)

Funny lines:
- I am writhing in sheer agony, as the pain, of my soul, stretches to infinity, and I am reminded, of my mortality, as I gaze at the stars, in blight, of my bane
- You're dead. You're dad. You're Dead. Both
- Okay? Okay. Hah ha? Hah ha. Hah? Hah. Hah? Cool? Cool. Hah. Hah? Hah ha. Ha? Ha.
